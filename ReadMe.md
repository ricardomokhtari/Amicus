# AMICUS - An open source, educational and diagnostic tool for dementia

## NOTE: This is a work in progress.

Goal:
To create a verbal voice assistant AI that converses with users with 2 aims:
1. To present cognitive tests to the user that assess cognition
2. To help the user learn more about dementia by responding to questions

### In its current state, Amicus behaves like a very basic version of Siri/Google Assistant (except text not speech input).

#### Coming soon:
 - Text input format to replaced with speech input
 - Full cognitive testing suite
